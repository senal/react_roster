# My speacial notes

## Components

### Validating properties in React's way

- Validate props with propTypes
- Supports validation of existence, data type or a custom condition


### Mixing
- Mixings allow many code to be merged into many components
- React compinent life cycle methods.
    - getInitialState
    - componentDidUpdate

### Summary
- Components are the building blocks of  React applications.
    - React application constructed from many  components  and a react application is a React component
    - Components are composable
    - Components map to a equivalent DOM nodes
    - React.Component defines a component
    - ReactDOM.render renders a component definition into the DOM
    - Props provide immutable data for a component
    - State provide mutable data for a component
    - proptTypes allow basic validation of props
    - Mixins allow reuse between components
